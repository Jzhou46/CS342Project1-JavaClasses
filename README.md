# JavaClasses
You are to code the following two classes in the Java language. For each class, make sure to implement all the fields and methods, whether static or non-static, according to the specifications below. Also, make sure to choose appropriate access levels, according to the principle of information hiding, for each field and method. Information hiding requires a class to prevent access to implementation of the class (i.e., the fields of the class) from clients of the class. Both classes should be implemented a single Eclipse project whose name is the concatenation of your last name and the word “Mp1”. For instance, if your last name is “Smith”, you should name your project “SmithMp1”.
